# yolov4-custom-functions: _Data Generation Features_
## You can find the custom functions I added for data generation in /core.functions.py

This project is an upgrade on the YOLOv3 project I've done. Here I've upgraded to YOLOv4 to increase accuracy and speed. 
By the outcomes of this project, I've written a paper and presented it at the **InDabaX international conference 2021** and published a paper entitled _On Demand Mass Transit Service In Addis Ababa_. Be sure to Check it out on Page 216: https://ejssd.astu.edu.et/index.php/EJSSD/issue/archive
 
To try out the custom functions, try running _python detect_video.py --weights ./checkpoints/yolov4-416 --size 416 --model yolov4 --video 0 --output ./detections/results.avi --count --detect_item person_ to detect and export data to the _csv_exports_ folder.

A wide range of custom functions for YOLOv4

DISCLAIMER: This repository is very similar to my repository: [tensorflow-yolov4-tflite](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite).

# Tensorflow GPU
conda env create -f conda-gpu.yml
conda activate yolov4-gpu
```

### Pip
```bash
# TensorFlow CPU
pip install -r requirements.txt

# TensorFlow GPU
pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt
```
## Downloading Official Pre-trained Weights
YOLOv4 comes pre-trained and able to detect 80 classes. For easy demo purposes we will use the pre-trained weights.
Download pre-trained yolov4.weights file: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cewMfusmPjYWbrnuJRuKhPMwRe_b9PaT

Copy and paste yolov4.weights from your downloads folder into the 'data' folder of this repository.

If you want to use yolov4-tiny.weights, a smaller model that is faster at running detections but less accurate, download file here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v4_pre/yolov4-tiny.weights

## YOLOv4 Using Tensorflow (tf, .pb model)
To implement YOLOv4 using TensorFlow, first we convert the .weights into the corresponding TensorFlow model files and then run the model.
```bash
# Convert darknet weights to tensorflow
## yolov4
python save_model.py --weights ./data/yolov4.weights --output ./checkpoints/yolov4-416 --input_size 416 --model yolov4 

# Run yolov4 tensorflow model
python detect.py --weights ./checkpoints/yolov4-416 --size 416 --model yolov4 --images ./data/images/kite.jpg

# Run yolov4 on video
python detect_video.py --weights ./checkpoints/yolov4-416 --size 416 --model yolov4 --video ./data/video/video.mp4 --output ./detections/results.avi

# Run yolov4 on webcam
python detect_video.py --weights ./checkpoints/yolov4-416 --size 416 --model yolov4 --video 0 --output ./detections/results.avi
```
If you want to run yolov3 or yolov3-tiny change ``--model yolov3`` and .weights file in above commands.

<strong>Note:</strong> You can also run the detector on multiple images at once by changing the --images flag like such ``--images "./data/images/kite.jpg, ./data/images/dog.jpg"``

Here is how to use all the currently supported custom functions and flags that I have created.

### Counting Objects (total objects or per class)
I have created a custom function within the file [core/functions.py](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/yolov4-custom-functions/blob/master/core/functions.py) that can be used to count and keep track of the number of objects detected at a given moment within each image or video. It can be used to count total objects found or can count number of objects detected per class.

#### Count Total Objects
To count total objects all that is needed is to add the custom flag "--count" to your detect.py or detect_video.py command.
```
# Run yolov4 model while counting total objects detected
python detect.py --weights ./checkpoints/yolov4-416 --size 416 --model yolov4 --images ./data/images/dog.jpg --count
```
Running the above command will count the total number of objects detected and output it to your command prompt or shell as well as on the saved detection as so:
<p align="center"><img src="data/helpers/total_count.png" width="640"\></p>

#### Count Objects Per Class
To count the number of objects for each individual class of your object detector you need to add the custom flag "--count" as well as change one line in the detect.py or detect_video.py script. By default the count_objects function has a parameter called <strong>by_class</strong> that is set to False. If you change this parameter to <strong>True</strong> it will count per class instead.

To count per class make detect.py or detect_video.py look like this:
<p align="center"><img src="data/helpers/by_class_config.PNG" width="640"\></p>

Then run the same command as above:
```
# Run yolov4 model while counting objects per class
python detect.py --weights ./checkpoints/yolov4-416 --size 416 --model yolov4 --images ./data/images/dog.jpg --count
```
Running the above command will count the number of objects detected per class and output it to your command prompt or shell as well as on the saved detection as so:
<p align="center"><img src="data/helpers/perclass_count.png" width="640"\></p>

<strong>Note:</strong> You can add the --count flag to detect_video.py commands as well!
